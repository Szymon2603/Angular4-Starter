# Angular4-Starter
Minimal starter Angular 4 + Webpack 2 + Sass + Bootstrap based on Angular documentation and many others tricks&amp;tips found in Github and StackOverflow

## Quick overview
All webpack config files are based on [Angular documentation](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/webpack.html). I added configurations to process .scss files, bootstrap deps and import them in AppComponent.

I skipped some dependencies like test frameworks or tslint. The main cause of this is that I was looking for minimal
starter for Angular 4 with some CSS framework included (as example) and I couldn't find anything like this.
